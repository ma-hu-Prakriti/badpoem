I'm writing a poem that's bad

I don't know what to write

hope you are glad



twinkle twinkle little star

how i wonder what u r

up above the fly so high

like a diamond in the sky


I'm writing a poem that's bad

I don't know what to write

hope you are glad


Twinkle twinkle little star

How I wonder what you are

Up above the world so high

Like a diamond in the sky


I'm writing a poem that's bad

I don't know what to write

hope you are glad
